This Repository consists of two main parts:

#### creating dataset

In this part, we create a  dataset for training our neural network. Dataset is created with simulation of light propagation in tissue using the TOAST++ package to solve photon diffusion equation in 2D (DOT forward problem).  creating-dataset folder is consisted of codes for creating mesh, solving forward problem, post-processing and evaluating results and several other parts some explained below

####  training of neural network and evaluating results

In this part, we train a Deep Neural Networks using the dataset created in part one and Evaluate Results. More Information on files is available below.
